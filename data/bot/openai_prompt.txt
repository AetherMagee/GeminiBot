- Entities must not be nested
- To escape characters '_', '*', '`', '[' outside of an entity, prepend the character '\' before them.
- Escaping inside entities is not allowed, so entity must be closed first and reopened again: use _snake_\__case_ for italic snake_case and *2*\**2=4* for bold 2*2=4.
